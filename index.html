            My experiences of living in Memphis
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a native Memphian with a desire to help my city grow and develop into a place where people would be proud to live and work in.

            Things I love about Memphis:
        </h2>

                <li>Culture</li>
                <p>
                    The culture of Memphis can be defined by three things: our place in Soul music folklore, our undying enthusiasm for sports, 
                    and our Grit & Grind mentality. Stax Records once produced talents such as Isaac Hayes, The Bar-Kays, and Otis Redding. 
                    Sun Studios was home to Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, and Elvis Presley.
                    In addition to the numerous Memphis-made musicians, the Bluff City boasts plenty of athletic talent as well. 
                    Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway, Lorenzen Wright, Michael Oher, Quinton "Rampage" Jackson, and Jerry "The King" Lawler are a few notable 
                    athletes hailing from Memphis.
