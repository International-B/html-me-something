            My experiences of living in Memphis
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a native Memphian with a desire to help my city grow and develop into a place where people would be proud to live and work in.
        </p>

            Things I love about Memphis:
        </h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Culture</li>
                <p>
                    The culture of Memphis can be defined by three things: our place in Soul music folklore, our undying enthusiasm for sports, 
                    and our Grit & Grind mentality. Stax Records once produced talents such as Isaac Hayes, The Bar-Kays, and Otis Redding. 
                    Sun Studios laid claim to Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, and Elvis Presley. In addition to the numerous Memphis-made musicians,
                    the Bluff City boasts plenty of athletic talent as well. Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway, Lorenzen Wright, Michael Oher,
                    Quinton "Rampage" Jackson, and Jerry "The King" Lawler are a few notable athletes hailing from Memphis. 
                    Inspired by our Grizzlies, Memphians have adopted a "Grit & Grind" mentality that accurately reflects the blue-collar values
                    of the city.
                </p>
                <li>Food</li>
                <p>
                    The undisputed BBQ capital and a great food town overall, Memphis deserves a spot on any foodie's must-have list. 
                    There is a surprisingly diverse selection of restaurants around every part of Memphis.
                    My favorites places to eat in town are: Central BBQ, Mosa Bistro, Casablanca, Roxie's, Uncle Lou's, and Brother Juniper's.

            </ul>

        <h2 class="improvements">
            Things Memphis could improve:
        </h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Transportation</li>
                <p>
                    One thing that I lament about Memphis is the lack of reliable transportation for everyone. Anywhere you go requires a vehicle, 
                    which has to be insured, maintained, and fueled. If there was a way to reduce the use of personal vehicles on the road, whether utilizing 
                    subways, buses, trains or other public transportation, I think that it would be a huge benefit for the city and less of a financial burden on Memphians.
                </p>
                <li>Workforce Development</li>
                <p>
                    Once a public transportation infrastructure has been put in place, it could open up more business opportunities and attract 
                    new residents. Once those new businesses come, there could be more diversity when applicants search for jobs and not just settle for 
                    industrial jobs that are readily available.
                </p>
            </ul>
        </p>

            Final Words
        </h2>

            This is just a few thoughts that I wanted to share with everyone. Thanks for reading!
